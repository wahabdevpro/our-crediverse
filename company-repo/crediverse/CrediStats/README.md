## Context
The Smart Recharge Mananager is a concept demonstrator to explore the creation of rule based campaigns where the rules can be arbtrarily complex in terms of how the transaction context is filtered to determine campaing eligibilit. Currently only the creation of the campaigns and the capturing of campaign rules are shown.  

## Project Status
The project is about 70% complete at this time.  
The following functionality is outstanding:
* Uploading of segment(only upload) and location(upload and screen) list files. (Current thinking is that both can be done by one compoment and the Segment Component should be abstracted and used for locations as well.)
* There is more thinking required to clear up the requirmentes around Incentives and Communications. 
* The Incentives and Communication Screens need to be completed. 
* Loging in to Crediverse works for the happy cases, but needs more analysis and decent error flow handling.
* The requirements for how the campaing statistics should look should be created. 
* Very little time was spent on the server.  There is just enought server side code to serve the functionality.
