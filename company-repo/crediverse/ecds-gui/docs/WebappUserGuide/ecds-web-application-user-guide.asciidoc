== What is the Crediverse ECDS?

This chapter provides a brief summary of the *Crediverse - Electronic Credit Distribution Service* (ECDS) and the Web application to manage it. It also describes how to log in and out of the Web application. +
See the following sections:

 * The ECDS and its Web Application in a Nutshell
 * Logging In
 * Logging Out

=== Crediverse ECDS and its Web Application in a Nutshell

The *Crediverse - Electronic Credit Distribution Service* is an affordable alternative to a paper-based voucher systems, providing a secure and efficient virtual way to distribute credit to resellers and end users. As ECDS is virtual it is highly flexible by nature and is able to service complex distribution channels, while still being easy to configure around an operator's business rules. ECDS affords subscribers the convenience to top up their accounts from anywhere, with any value, at any time, through a recognised distribution network.  +

With the ever increasing trend of on-demand access to services and products from any location, rivalry within the credit distribution ecosystem is on the increase and Mobile Network Operators are seeking new ways to remain competitive and ensure their future sustainability through the consolidation of their wholesale distribution channels. Thus there are an increasing number of operators now looking to convert their legacy physical scratch card distribution channels to electronic platforms. However they are faced with a number of barriers when entering the electronic prepaid distribution space. These include access to flexible and efficient electronic distribution platforms, while remaining cost effective when compared to traditional scratch card based systems +

The *ECDS Web application* has an easy-to-use interface to allow the operator to create agent accounts at both wholesaler and reseller levels (known as Tiers) and then define *Transfer Rules* to govern how transactions between agents may take place. For example, it may be possible to set up a business rule, to award a 10% trade bonus when agents linked to a Wholesaler Tier, transfer airtime to agents linked to a Reseller Tier. +

The *ECDS Web application* also provides the features the operator needs to manage the distribution of airtime to first level wholesalers and report on the further distribution of that airtime to resellers. +

The user interface lets you manage and schedule various reports, manage users and assist wholesalers and resellers with certain operations, such as PIN resets, transaction adjustments or even reversals.

=== Logging In

Use this procedure to log in to the ECDS Web application. +
*Note*: The system administrator must define web users before they can login to the system. For more information, see the <<_adding_a_web_user>> section. +

Open the Web application’s *Login Page* URL.
*Note*: Obtain this URL from your network administrator. +

The Login page appears: +

image::ecds-web-application-user-guide-dd659.png[align="center" role="thumb left"]

In the  image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-49509.png[] text box, type your user name. +

*Note*: Your username is the same username which is configured on your Domain Controller or the one assigned to you by the Network Administrator. +

In the image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-95de8.png[] text box, type your password, which is set up on the Domain Controller or is the one assigned to you by the Network Administrator. +

It appears as dots in the Password text box. The password is case sensitive, and will comply to your internal Domain Controller password requirements or is the one assigned to you by the Network Administrator. +

Click image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-c7f1e.png[]. A page will appear requesting you to enter a one-time PIN which will be sent to you as an SMS on the mobile phone number that was recorded in your User profile. +

{nbsp} +

If for some reason you erased the SMS and cannot remember the PIN, click on image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-8d10a.png[]  which will result in a new one-time PIN SMS to be sent to your mobile phone. Enter the PIN and click on image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-1a6b5.png[] to log on. +

Alternatively, should you realise at this stage that you should have used a different username, click on image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-134c1.png[] which will take you back to the login page.

If the PIN validation is successful, the main ECDS page appears with a menu of options down the left hand side, your user name and the Agent Accounts page:

image::ecds-web-application-user-guide-7467d.png[role="thumb"]

The path to the current screen is displayed directly below the user name.

=== Logging Out

Always log out of the application after you have finished using it. This will ensure that the ECDS remains secure and stops an unauthorized person using the application.  +

Near the upper right corner of any page, the current logged in user name will appear, clicking on this Username will display a drop down menu:

image:ecds-web-application-user-guide-8260e.png[]

Click on image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-18b91.png[] to log out of ECDS. This will return you to the login page.  +
The Web application will not ask you to confirm your intention to log out. Should you wish to remain logged in, click on the Username again and the image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-18b91.png[] will disappear.

<<<

== Menu & Breadcrumbs


//image:ecds-web-application-user-guide-bd7a5.png[align="left" role="thumb left"]

The Main menu is ordered in priority of usage, with menu options for common actions, such as Agent Account lookups or Transaction information lookups placed at the top. +
Where a sub menu exists an < is shown to the right of the menu item.
Clicking on the < will expand the sub menu giving you further options. +

Note that the menu items displayed will depend on the logged in users role, which has been assigned. Some users may not see all menu options if they do not have the required permission in their assigned role. +
For example, the Configuration Menu item, will only be displayed to users with administrative permissions which allow them to manage and change configuration settings in ECDS. +

At the bottom of the menu is an image which can be changed to repesent your organisation. Please discuss this with the CrediVerse installer, to change the image.

image::ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-2555b.png[role="thumb"]

In the Agent search fields enter the known criteria to optimise your search result set. For example, if the Last name of the Agent is known, insert the Last name and click on image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-ffa53.png[] This will return a list of Agent Accounts where the Last name matches the Last name that you entered. The more fields entered in the search criteria, the more precise the result set. +
To erase all entered search criteria click on image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-9ccf9-grey-clear.png[]. To hide the advanced search fields, click on image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-229b8-grey-hide.png[] +

This will result in a detailed agent account display where you can see all Agent Account information.

image::ecds-web-application-user-guide-e4a68.png[role="thumb"]


The Agent Account information is displayed in two blocks, on the left, the Agent’s name and account number is displayed, along with their current balance.  +
On the right hand side, more detailed Agent Account information is displayed in several tab sheets, including the information for the fields as described in the table near the top of this <<_creating_a_new_agent_account,Creating a New Agent Account>> section, transaction data, AML Limits, Agent and API User information.

==== Agent AML limits

AML or Anti-Money-Laundering-Limits may be setup to limit the number and value of transactions an agent performs in a day or month. To view the AML limits for the currently selected agent select the image:ecds-web-application-user-guide-ec841.png[role="thumb"] tab on the view agent screen and you will see something similar to the following:

image::ecds-web-application-user-guide-0af67.png[role="thumb"]

To change any of the AML Limits for the Agent, please see <<_Editing_An_Agent_>>.

==== Agent transactions

Within the Agent View screen, it is possible to see a sequential list of the most recent transactions related to the Agent. This includes both inbound transactions, where the agent may have received a transfer from another agent as well as transactions that the agent has made themselves. +
To see the Agent Transactions, select the image:ecds-web-application-user-guide-07e7d.png[] tab and you will be presented with agent transaction search criteria as follows:

image::ecds-web-application-user-guide-f1498.png[role="thumb"]

The following search criteria may be used to filter the result set:

|===
|*Filter Criteria*|*Definition*
|Relation|This indicates the relationship of the transactions to the Agent in focus. Please see the transaction relationship table below for explanation of each relationship type
|Date and time range| This is the from and to date range, which by default is set to the past 7 days
|Transaction Number| This fields allows the user to specify a specific transaction number if a single transaction is to be retrieved
|Transaction types| This indicates the Transaction type to search for, for example, Airtime Sale, Bundle Sale, Transfer, Reversal, Adjudication etc.
|Include queries| By default, sales and deposit query transactions are excluded from the result set, these can be included by selecting this check box
|Retrieve record counted| By default, record count is not included to optimise the speed of the query. A record count takes time, to count through the entire database to see how many records match the search criteria, so should only be used if this information is required
|===

IMPORTANT: Filters where Queries and Record counts are included will take longer to execute

The table below explains the differences between the various Relation Filters which may be applied to the search:
|===
|*Relation Filter*|*Definition*
|Own Transactions| This filter will show transactions where the Agent in focus is either the A or B party in the transaction
|Own Outbound Transactions| This shows only transactions where the Agent in focus is the A party, i.e. transactions which the Agent initiated
|Own Inbound Transactions| This shows only transactions where the Agent in focus is the B party, i.e. transactions in which the Agent was on the receiving end
|Owner of A side | This shows transactions for sub-agents, where the Agent in focus is the owner of the A party
|Owner of B side | This shows transactions for sub-agents, where the Agent in focus is the owner of the B party
|All transactions| This shows all transactions, including the Agents Own and all transactions of sub Agents where the Agent in focus is owner of the A or B party
|===

IMPORTANT: Use at least one filter criteria, the more filter criteria the quicker a result is returned

After entering all desired search criteria, click image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-d6d56.png[] which will cause all transactions satisfying the search criteria to be displayed.
To enter new search criteria, click on image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-9ccf9-grey-clear.png[] and all previously entered criteria will be erased, ready to enter new criteria. When searching is complete.

The results will be displayed similar to the following:

image::ecds-web-application-user-guide-39bec.png[role="thumb"]

It is possible to drill into a single transaction by selecting the Transaction Number, which in turn will provide a detailed Transaction view. See <<_viewing_transactions>> for details of what is shown. +
ECDS offers the facility to export this Transaction detail to a CSV file in the identical format and using the naming convention as described in the <<_batch_import,Batch Processing>> section below. The file will be exported to the download location defined in the settings of the web browser you are using. To accomplish the export, click on the image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-9dbc4-blue-export.png[]  button and inspect the configured download location.


==== Agent Users

Agent Users are Web Users of the Agent Portal. Where certain Agents have been granted access to the WebUI <<_Bearer_Channels_>>, the Agent may assign Agent Users, with specific Roles and Permissions, which would allow the agents to perform front office or call centre functions using the Agent Portal.
To view a list of existing Agent Users which have been linked to the currently selected Agent, click on the image:ecds-web-application-user-guide-5d4d0.png[role="thumb"] tab, and you will be presented with a list of linked Agent Users, as follows:

image::ecds-web-application-user-guide-f6d35.png[role="thumb"]

NOTE: Agent users may transact on behalf of the Agent, depending on the permissions given.

There is one predefined permanent Agent User role, namely ‘Agent All’ which provides all possible permissions an Agent User could have. To setup more restrictive Agent User roles, please refer to <<_Associating_Permissions_with_A_Role_>>

Each Agent User is linked to one and only one Role.

API Users are associated with an Agent's Crediverse account in ECDS and allows the Agent to connect to the ECDS Transaction Server using the ECDS REST API. The API User is created and associated with the Agent Account, in the Agent View Screen.
Roles for API Users are setup and managed in <<_Associating_Permissions_with_A_Role_>> and then a Role with specific permissions may be assigned to an API User.
The API User is only permitted to access ECDS using the API <<_Bearer_Channels_>>.

To view a list of existing API Users which have been linked to the currently selected Agent, click on the image:ecds-web-application-user-guide-cc3ee.png[role="thumb"] tab, and you will be presented with a list of linked API Users, as follows:

image::ecds-web-application-user-guide-9cb44.png[role="thumb"]

NOTE: API users may transact on behalf of the Agent, depending on the Roles and Permissions assigned to the user.

There is one predefined permanent Agent User role, namely ‘AgentAll’ which provides all possible permissions an Agent, Agent Usr or API User could have. To setup more restrictive Agent User roles, please refer to <<_Associating_Permissions_with_A_Role_>>

Each API User is linked to one and only one Role.

== My Tasks

Certain actions performed by the users of the web application require a second suitably authorised user to co-authorise an action, such as a root account Replenish, or a Transaction Reversal.
This co-authorisation could happen immediately at the time the transaction is performed, provided the co-authorising person, is present at the computer of the person requesting the transaction.
Alternatively, the person originating the transaction can request co-authorisation, to be completed at a later time or on another computer by another user which has the required permissions.
In cases where co-authorisation is requested, clicking on image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-137ba.png[] will display the status of any items requested for co-authorisation by the currently logged in user, as shown below:

image::ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-1156f.png[role="thumb"]

As soon as a Requested co-authorisation is initiated, a task is sent to all suitably authorised web application users' inboxes and all are notified of the request by SMS.
The first user to process the request will at the same time cause the request to be removed from all the other suitably qualified users' inboxes and all notified web users shall also receive an SMS to indicate that the request has been processed and what the outcome was.

Three tabs are shown. Clicking on image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-e9793.png[] shows any tasks that the logged in web application user can take actions on.
The actions possible for the user's own Requested co-authorisations is limited to image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-f54c9.png[] which will remove the approval request from any co-authoriser's inbox.
If the web application user has permissions to co-authorise a request, clicking on either "approve" or "decline" will cause a one-time PIN to be sent to that user's mobile phone. This PIN must then be entered to complete the approval/decline action.
All other notified users, will be updated with the outcome of the action.

Clicking on the image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-0abc3.png[] tab will display a list of only those actions that someone else should approve for the web application user. +

Click on image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-fe0f3.png[] to see a list of co-authorisations that have already been processed:

image::ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-7472e.png[role="thumb"]

This screen shows whether a Requested co-authorisation has been approved or rejected, identifying the user that took the action and the reason given by that user for the action.

|Status|An indicator to show whether the transaction was successful, or if not, the reason for its failure.
|===

To change the sequence in which transactions are displayed, simply click on a column heading. This will cause the transaction list to be displayed in a sequence determined by the column content. Click again on the same column heading to reverse the sequence. Sorting on Agent columns is not available. The column on which sequence is based has a image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-fd407-ascending.png[] icon adjacent to the column heading, indicating an ascending sequence, or a image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-6cba9-descending.png[] icon indicating descending sequence.

It is possible to change the number of transactions displayed on a page by selecting a different value from the drop-down list displayed when clicking on image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-1e63d.png[] below the image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-6dff7.png[] column. Use the image:ecds-web-application-user-guide-f894a.png[] buttons displayed at bottom right to display the next or previous page of transactions.

Clicking on the transaction number in the image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-6dff7.png[] column results in a detailed view of the transaction in question as partially shown below:

image::ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-5c121.png[role="thumb"]

=== Searching for a Transaction

If the transaction number or the mobile phone number of any party to the transaction is known, it can be entered in the image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-5f61e-quick-filter.png[] to find the transaction or the list of transactions relating to the search criteria. +

Search criteria can be refined by clicking on the image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-85471.png[] button at the top of the page. This action results in additional search criteria being displayed:

image::ecds-web-application-user-guide-2c6e1.png[role="thumb"]

Transaction records can be found based on any one or a combination of the search criteria shown. The more criteria you enter, the finer grained your search results.
After entering all desired search criteria, click image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-d6d56.png[] which will cause all transactions satisfying the search criteria to be displayed.
To enter new search criteria, click on image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-9ccf9-grey-clear.png[] and all previously entered criteria will be erased, ready to enter new criteria. When searching is complete, click on image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-229b8-grey-hide.png[] to cause the search text boxes to disappear.

TIP: There is a checkbox for _Retrieving Record Count_, which by default is not checked. This is to optimise the search result being displayed. If you explicitly want to know _how many_ transactions meet your search criteria, check the "Retrieve Record Count" checkbox before searching.

NOTE: By default Query type transactions are excluded, these are transactions like balance query, sales and deposit queries which the agent has executed. To include these, select the include Queries checkbox.

=== Reversing a Transaction


It is possible to reverse sales, transfers and self top-up transactions. Should a transaction happen in error for any reason, it could be reversed, i.e. the status restored as if the transaction never took place. If the amount of a transaction was incorrectly entered, a transaction could also be partially reversed. Such reversals are only possible if the Web Application user is suitably authorised and requires co-authorisation by a second suitably authorised Web Application user.  +
To reverse a transaction first locate the transaction by viewing the *details* for that transaction as shown in the <<_viewing_transactions,Viewing Transactions>> section above. On the transaction detail page, click the image:ECDS-Web-Application-User-Guide-bed7c.png[] button. A reversal pop-up window appears:

=== Adjudication of a Transaction marked for Follow up [[_Adjudicatin_of_a_transaction_marked_for_follow_up_]]

In the event that an Airtime Sales transaction did not receive a known successful or failure response from the Online Charging Systems (OCS), ECDS marks that transaction for Follow Up. +
All transactions marked for follow-up should be manually investigated and then Adjudicated to mark the transaction as a Success or Failure. +

NOTE: At the time of the transaction, the transaction amount is debited from the Agents balance and placed into a Hold Account for the Agent, pending an investigation.

==== Searching for Transactions marked for Follow up

It is possible to search for transactions which are *Pending Adjudication* or *ALL*, by selecting the follow-up filter Criteria in the Transaction Advanced Search screen as follows:

image::ecds-web-application-user-guide-12154.png[role="thumb"]

One of the following filter conditions can be selected:

|===
|*Follow-Up filter*|*Definition*
|ignore follow up indicator|This ignores follow up indicators in the search criteria
|ALL|Returns all Transactions which were marked for Follow-Up, including both adjudicated and non-adjudicated transactions
|Pending Adjudication|Returns only those transactions which are Pending Adjudication, i.e. those transactions requiring some action
|===

==== The Adjudication Process

From the search result, select a transaction to adjudicate, by clicking on the transaction number, and you will be presented with the transaction detail view, similar to the example below: +

image::ecds-web-application-user-guide-de483.png[role="thumb"]

At the bottom of the transaction detail view, check the following information to assist with investigation: +

image:ecds-web-application-user-guide-ec67c.png[role="thumb"]

This information has the following Relevance to the investigation:
|===
|*Field name*|*Relevance*
|Status|This indicates the transaction result.
|Last External Result Code|Where available, this indicates the return code provided by the external system
|Rolled Back|This indicates if the transaction has been adjudicated and rolled back, i.e. marked as Failure
|Follow-Up|The follow up indicator is set by the ECDS system, whenever a transaction receives an unclear result or timeouts towards an external system during the transaction.
|Additional Information|This indicates any additional information which may assist in investigation, in the example above, the IP address of the OCS node which returned error code 999 is provided
|===

Using the above and other relevant transaction information, investigate the transaction on the OCS to determine whether the transaction completed successfully or not.

== Batch Processing

ECDS offers the facility to create and maintain certain classes of information and transactions using batch file imports in the place of manually entering information via the Web Application. The types of information and transactions that could be imported via batch files are:
 * Web Users and Departments
 * Tiers
 * Service Classes
 * Accounts
 * Groups
 * Transfer Rules
 * Adjustments (Bonus Exclusive)
 * Adjustments (Bonus Inclusive)
 * Departments
 * Location information, including Areas, cells and cell groups
 * Promotions +

WARNING: **The ECDS Batch Processing facility complies with CSV standard RFC4180, which includes:** +
 * Batch files have a header row containing the field names separated by commas +
 * Fields are separated with commas (ASCII 44) +
 * Lines are separated with a single NEW LINE (ASCII 10) +
 * Text fields containing commas are encapsulated within double quotation marks (ASCII 34) +
 * Quotation marks within text fields are escaped with another quotation mark (ASCII 34), note that this includes fields with multiple values, for example, when adding two areas for a cell, the two areas should be comma separated but within quotes, for example "Area1,Area2" +
 * Each record is represented on one and only one line +
 * Null or not applicable fields are left blank, e.g. 10,,Red +
 * The column order is not significant as long as the header and field contents are aligned +

TIP: To obtain the latest batch file import format, select the file type you which to import from the Batch Processing Menu and the system will export an empty batch file in CSV format with the correct column headings.

NOTE: The system will not allow you to import the same file name more than once, so always change your filename before attempting to import data into ECDS.

TIP: Do not insert the id field when ADDing records by batch. The id is ignored in batch files for ADD records.

=== Special fields in Batch files
Certain fields as specified in the import spec require parameterised data, for example, for Active Status on an Agent record, an “A” is used. +
The sections below outline Parameterised data in more detail and should be referred to when creating batch import files, in order to avoid import files being rejected, due to invalid data.


==== Batch Verb [[__batch_verb]]
Verbs determine what sort of processing will be done with the data supplied. The following verbs may be specified:
|===
|*Verb*|*Semantics*
|add|Add the record. Fail if it already exists.

=== Import Bonus Inclusive Adjustments

Adjustments can be performed, Where the amount supplied includes the calculated bonus provision amount (called total_amount in the batch file) or where the amount excludes the bonus provision amount (called amount in the batch file).

WARNING: It is very important to ensure you clearly understand the difference between Bonus Exclusive and Bonus Inclusive Adjustments, when performing a batch adjustment, as the field in the batch file will indicate the processing behaviour.

This template is for batch processing of Bonus *Inclusive* adjustments.
The Total_Amount field in this template INCLUDES the bonus provision amount, the bonus provision amount is first calculated by the system and
deducted from the Total_Amount stipulated in the batch file, before the Agents balance is adjusted and the difference is allocated as a Bonus Provision Amount.

TIP: For both USSD and SMS commands, words enclosed in curly braces {} represent variables in the ECDS system. Any string entered in the corresponding position in the command will be used as the value of that variable in ECDS. +

* {RecipientMSISDN}	The mobile phone number of the recipient Agent +
* {PIN}			The sender Agent’s PIN +
* {Amount}		The amount transferred from the sender to the recipient +



The USSD command must start with an asterisk (*) and end with a hash sign (#). Every variable should be separated from the next by an asterisk. Examples of valid USSD command configurations are:

 * \*123*6*{PIN}\*{Amount}*{RecipientMSISDN}#
 * \*987*{Amount}\*{PIN}*{RecipientMSISDN}#

The SMS command must start with the word STOCK followed by the variables needed, namely the amount, the PIN and the recipient’s mobile phone number in any order separated by spaces. The SMS command must end in the application terminating SMS number the command should be sent to, preceded by =>. Examples of valid SMS command configurations are:

 * STOCK {PIN} {Amount} RecipientMSISDN}=>123
 * STOCK {Amount} {PIN} {RecipientMSISDN}=>987


NOTE: For notifications, sections of the notification message enclosed in curly braces {} represent variables in ECDS and will be replaced in the message with the actual value of that variable. +
