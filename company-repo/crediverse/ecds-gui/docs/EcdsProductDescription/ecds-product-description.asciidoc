== Scope

=== Identification

This document contains the *Product Description (PD)* for the *Concurrent Systems’ Crediverse Electronic Credit Distribution System* (hereafter referred to as “Crediverse”).

=== Executive Summary

Crediverse is a complete airtime credit distribution and sales system for Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) that allows them to optimize the distribution of airtime credit seamlessly across their hierarchical network of agent resellers. This highly reliable, secure and performant product enables operators to monitor and manage all aspects of their credit distribution network so as to efficiently distribute airtime and sell bundles, whilst reducing operational cost. Crediverse provides operators the ability to  increase revenue and grow market share with a very low capital expenditure and cost of ownership.

==== Reduction in Operational Costs

===== Reduction of Scratch Card Design and Printing Costs

The cost of designing and printing expensive paper based scratch cards will be reduced with the deployment of a voucherless system, as scratch cards  are quickly phased out as the market adjusts to the concept of voucherless recharge.

===== Reduction of Logistics, Transportation, Storage and Inventory Management Costs

The related cost of logistics, transportation, storage and inventory management will also reduce as scratch cards fall away.

===== Reduction of Security Costs

Security costs are reduced, as security measures around production of scratch cards, and keeping them secure from theft or fraud once produced, are no longer relevant.

===== Reduction of Terminal Management Costs

In the case of electronic voucher distribution (EVD) the number of point of sale (POS) terminals will diminish with the introduction of Crediverse, as agents  now use their mobile phones to sell airtime credit and promotional bundles.  This translates into a reduction in terminal management and maintenance costs.

[[reduction-in-capex-spend]]
==== Reduction in Capex Spend



[[reduction-of-capex-spend-for-pos-terminals-and-integration]]
===== Reduction of Capex Spend for POS Terminals and Integration

As Crediverse negates the need for POS devices there will be a reduction in terms of capex spend related to the purchase of new kiosks,POS terminals.

[[revenue-gain-and-improved-market-share]]
==== Revenue Gain and Improved Market Share


[[increase-revenue-by-agents-selling-promo-bundles-directly-to-subscribers]]
===== Increase Revenue by Agents Selling Promotional Bundles Directly to Subscribers

Crediverse is fully integrated with Concurrent Systems’ Promotion Creation Centre (PCC) and enables agents in the field to market and sell promotional bundles directly to end subscribers. Operators have more flexibility and control in terms of their marketing strategy and can drive up sales of certain promotions by incentivizing agents on the ground to promote specific bundles. By giving agents the ability to sell bundles directly to subscribers this overcomes any sales impediment as a result of subscriber illiteracy, or ignorance with regards to the available bundle offerings.


[[increase-revenue-market-share-by-targeting-new-subscribers]]
===== Increase Revenue & Market Share by Targeting New Subscribers

Operators can target new subscribers in untapped or remote areas that were previously impractical or unfeasible to reach from a transportation or logistical cost perspective. This expands the operator’s subscriber base, thus increasing airtime revenues and improving market share.

[[increase-arpu-with-flexible-denominations-of-airtime-credit]]
===== Increase ARPU with Flexible Denominations of Airtime Credit

With Crediverse being voucherless, subscribers are not constrained by predetermined voucher amounts. Any denomination of airtime can be sold according to the subscriber’s cash-on-hand at the time of sale. This ensures that funds earmarked for communication are not squandered elsewhere if the subscriber does not happen to have enough funds on him to buy an airtime voucher at a predetermined amount. Also agents usually tend to keep smaller denominations of scratch cards on-hand for fear of being stolen. With Crediverse both these factors are no longer a concern and subscribers can access any amount of airtime they desire, thus increasing ARPU.

[[increase-revenue-by-growing-the-size-of-agent-distribution-network]]
===== Increase Revenue by Growing the Size of Agent Distribution Network

In Africa access to power can pose a challenge and often limits the number of terminals in use, which means fewer agents. ith Crediverse all a potential agent needs to start earning money is access to a cell phone and funds to buy airtime Crediverse creates new jobs, increasing the size of the agent distribution base. More operator agents in the field equates to increased sales.
 +

[[increase-revenue-by-high-availability-of-airtime-credit]]
===== Increase Revenue by High Availability of Airtime Credit

With electronic pinless/voucherless airtime distribution, the transfer of airtime to wholesalers and retailers via Crediverse happens in an instant and airtime credit is accessible 24 hours a day. Agents are thus assured that they will never run out of stock, as is possible with scratch cards. Furthermore they don’t need to be constrained by using POS terminals in locations that may only be open during certain business hours. Another factor to consider is that agents face a significant risk of theft when carrying large amounts of scratch card vouchers. With Crediverse being totally virtual this risk is no longer relevant. Guaranteed availability and 24/7 access of airtime credit means increased revenues.

[[increase-revenue-by-using-near-real-time-data-to-boost-promotional-campaigns]]
===== Increase Revenue by Using Near Real-time Data to Boost Promotional Campaigns

Unlike the scratch cards that have no automated mechanism for monitoring airtime sales, Crediverse includes Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) which is essentially a dashboard with visual representations of key performance indicators. This allows the marketing team to fine-tune promotional campaigns on-the-fly and incentivize agents using near real-time sales data to improve uptake.

[[increase-market-share-through-improved-recharge-user-experience]]
===== Increase Market Share through improved Recharge User Experience

Crediverse affords subscribers the convenience to top-up their accounts with any amount of credit, at any time, through a recognized distribution network of agents who are conveniently located. This convenience in conjunction with fewer subscriber transaction steps improves overall user experience and drives customer loyalty, which in turn secures the operator’s market share.

[[theory-of-operation]]
== Theory of Operation

[[overview]]
=== Overview

Suitably authorized Web Users (operatorPersonnel) create and manage all aspects of the Agent network, including Agent Master Data, Agent segmentation (Types, Tiers, Groups, Service Classes) and Agent permissions.

Designated and duly authorized personnel then replenish the balance of available credit to be distributed and sold through the network.

Wholesaler Agents sell credit to other wholesalers and retailers using credit transfer transactions via USSD, SMS, Smart Phones or an Agent Web Portal, subject to business rules defined by the operator.

Retailer Agents sell Airtime or Bundles using USSD, SMS or Smart Phone to subscribers or to themselves (Self-Topup).

Operator personnel monitor the operation via OSS, Reports and OLAP exports and adjust the business rules and parameters to optimize revenue as required.

[[distribution-network]]
=== Distribution Network

In Crediverse, a distribution network with its associated rules is defined to govern the flow of credit from a single Root to the point where it reaches individual Subscribers.

The Crediverse can be understood in terms of a directed graph as depicted in <<figure-distribution_network>>:


[[figure-distribution_network]]
.Distribution Network
image::image004.png[align="center"]



In this graph:

. Vertices represent the various Tiers through which credit flows before it reaches Subscribers.

. Directional arrows represent the actual flow of credit as governed by Transfer Rules.
+
--
The topmost Tier is referred to as the Root Tier. When credit is replenished by the Operator, it is placed in a single Root Account within this Tier.

Credit is then transferred (sold) Agents belonging to other tiers subject to Transfer Rules.

In the final instance, Agents belonging to a Retailer Tier, sell credit or bundles to subscribers who all implicitly belong the Subscriber Tier.
--

[NOTE]
====
. Crediverse allows agents belonging to the same Tier to transfer credit (intra-tier) freely to each other.

. The distribution network is directed, but doesn’t have to be strictly hierarchical. For instance, in the diagram above, the Root Tier is able to transfer to a Wholesaler Tier (W2) or bypass the Wholesaler Tier and transfer from Root to Retailer Tier (R3).

. It is possible to define more than one Transfer Rule between Tiers which will apply under different circumstances.
====

[[transactions]]
=== Transactions

The following transactions are facilitated by Crediverse:

[[replenish]]
==== Replenish

This is the action causing new credit to be created in the root tier for ultimate distribution via the agent network to subscribers. Replenish transactions can only be performed by duly authorized Web Users (operator employees) using the Web User Interface (WUI).

The amount to be added to the Root account for distribution and sales is specified, together with the amount required to pay Agent trade bonuses and incentives.


NOTE: For security, this transaction will require co-authorization form another duly authorized Web User before it is committed.

[[transfer]]
==== Transfer

Credit transfers allow the operator to move credit from the root account to other in-house accounts or to wholesaler Agents using the Web User Interface. For security, this transaction will require co-authorization form another duly authorized Web User before it is committed.

Wholesalers use Transfer transactions via USSD, SMS, Smartphone or the Agent Portal to transfer credit to other wholesalers and retailers subject to strict Transfer Rules defined by the operator.

These Transfer Rules also determine how much Trade Bonus a Wholesaler earns for the transaction.


[[sell]]
==== Sell

Retailers sell credit to Subscribers via SMS, Smartphone or USSD subject to operator defined transfer rules.

[[sell-bundle]]
==== Sell Bundle

Retailers can also sell bundles consisting of pre-defined benefits, e.g. Airtime, Data, SMS and MMS to Subscribers via SMS, Smartphone or USSD subject to operator defined Transfer Rules.

[[self-topup]]
==== Self-Topup

Wholesalers and Retailers are allowed to “Sell” Airtime to themselves via USSD, SMS, Smartphone or Agent Portal using a Self-Topup transaction. The net effect of this transaction is to move credit from the Agent’s Crediverse account to his subscriber account on the Onlinea Charging System.

NOTE: Agents will not earn any commissions for Self-Topup.

[[adjustment]]
==== Adjustment

At the discretion of the operator, the Crediverse balance of an Agent may be adjusted up or down using the Crediverse Web UI or a batch process.

The net effect of the Adjustment transaction is to debit the Agent’s balance and credit the Root account balance or vice versa.

NOTE: For security, this transaction will require co-authorization from another duly authorized Web User before it is committed.


[[pin-registration]]
==== PIN Registration

When enabled by the operator, a new Agent will first receive a temporary PIN via SMS which he must use to register a chosen PIN before he can perform any other transactions.

The operatorwill also be able to perform a PIN reset for an Agent after which he must register a new PIN again.

This transaction is available via SMS, Smartphone or USSD.



[[pin-change]]
==== PIN Change

An Agent will at any time be able to change his PIN with a PIN Change transaction, by supplying both his old and new PINs. This transaction is available via SMS, Smartphone or USSD.

[[reversal]]
==== Reversal

Sales, Transfer and Self Topup transactions can be reversed by a suitably authorized Web User using the Crediverse Web UI.

Reversal Transactions will credit the seller (source) agent and debit the buyer (recipient) with the full amount of the original transaction.

NOTE: For security, this transaction will require co-authorization from another duly authorized Web User before it is committed.

[[partial-reversal]]
==== Partial Reversal

In the case where a Reversal cannot be performed due to the recipient having insufficient credit/airtime, a Partial Reversal can be performed for an amount which is less than the original transaction amount.

NOTE: For security, this transaction will require co-authorization from another duly authorized Web User before it is committed.

[[adjudication]]
==== Adjudication

In the unlikely event that the outcome of a provisioning operation on the Online Charging System (OCS) cannot be determined, the corresponding Crediverse transaction is marked for Follow-Up.

A suitably authorized Web-User can use Adjudication Transactions to assert whether the indeterminate transaction actually succeeded or not.

If it is asserted that the indeterminate did fail, the Agent’s funds are returned to his account.

NOTE: For security, this transaction will require co-authorization from another duly authorized Web User before it is committed.

[[reward]]
==== Reward

Reward Transactions are not executed explicitly by Web Users or Agents.

Reward Transactions are generated periodically by Crediverse when it is determined that an Agent has fulfilled the eligibility criteria for a Bonus incentive.

The net effect of this transaction is that the Root Account is debited and the Agent’s account credited with the reward amount.

[[queries]]
=== Queries

Crediverse allows Agents to track their accounts and activities using the following queries via webportal, USSD, Smartphone and SMS:

[[balance-enquiry]]
==== Balance Enquiry

View the Agent’s available Crediverse account balance.

[[transaction-status-query]]
==== Transaction Status Query

View the status of an historic transaction performed by an Agent.

[[last-transaction-query]]
==== Last Transaction Query

View the details of the last transaction performed by an Agent.

[[sales-query]]
==== Sales Query

View a summary of Sales performed by an Agent since midnight.

[[deposits-query]]
==== Deposits Query

View a list of transfers into the Agent’s Crediverse account since midnight.

[[master-data]]
=== Master Data

Crediverse Master Data is defined and maintained by suitably authorized Web Users using the Web UI. In most instances, Master Data can also be uploaded and downloaded using a batch processing facility.

The following categories of Master Data are provided for by Crediverse:

[[security]]
==== Security

Security and loss control are key concerns in Crediverse. In the context of Master Data Maintenance, the following security aspects can be defined and maintained by suitably authorized Web Users:

=====  Permissions

Each business process and some individual actions within Crediverse processes are protected by permissions.

In particular, the creation, modification and deletion of each category of Master Data are protected by a permission which the initiator of the process must hold for the action to be allowed.

=====  Roles

Each Agent and Web User is linked to a Role.

Roles are collections of permissions which an Agent or Web User will inherit as a result of his role membership.

=====  Audit Entries

When any Master Data record is Created, Amended or Deleted, a corresponding Audit Log entry is created.

These entries can be viewed to reveal the old/new state of the affected records, as well as by whom, when and from where the Master Data was amended.

=====  Anti-Money Laundering (AML)

Various entities in Crediverse can be associated with Anti Money Laundering limits to detect and prevent possible fraud or money laundering.

When an Agent performs a Crediverse transaction, all of these limits will be verified before the transaction is allowed to proceed.

The following limits are associated with Anti Money Laundering:

* Maximum Transaction Amount.

* Maximum number of transactions per day.

* Maximum total value of transactions performed per day.

* Maximum number of transactions per month.

* Maximum total value of transactions performed per month.

=====  Tamper Detection

Crediverse implements a tamper detection mechanism which will detect if any sensitive data has been tampered with, e.g. when account balances are manipulated directly in the database.

=====  IMSI and IMEI Tracking

Crediverse can be configured to retrieve and record IMSI and IMEI numbers of Agents during transactions.

In the case of IMSI, Crediverse can detect SIM swap and temporary block an Agent from trading until the legality of the SIM swap is confirmed.

=====  Geo Location

When enabled, Crediverse will record the CellID from where an Agent performed a transaction for the purposes of security and business development.

=====  Account Dumps

Crediverse can be configured to periodically dump the state of Agent Accounts to a file for analysis by revenue management teams in order to reconcile transactions and account balances.

[[crediverse-users]]
==== Crediverse Users

=====  Web Users

Web Users are typically operator employees who need to interact with the Crediverse system.

Web Users are created by previously defined Web Users who are suitably authorized to do so.

Contact, demographic and Role membership information is amongst the information kept on record for each Web User.

Web Users can be authenticated against an external security provider, e.g. a Kerberos server (operator supplied) or using the ECDS internal Authentication method.

A highly privileged Administrator Web User is pre-configured in Crediverse when it is installed.

NOTE: For security purposes, the administrator is not able to perform any transactions in Crediverse. The Administrator User is intended for the initial boot up of master data, after which his access should be constrained.

=====  Departments

Various departments can be defined and linked to Web Users to partition large numbers of Web Users.

[[agentsaccounts]]
==== Agents/Accounts

=====  Agents

Agents interact with the Crediverse system for the purpose of transferring credit to other agents or selling Airtime and Bundles to Subscribers.

Agents are typically not operatoremployees, but Crediverse allows for the creation of ‘Internal Agents’ as well.

Contact, demographic, Anti Money Laundering Limits (AML) and Role membership information is amongst the information kept on record for each Agent.

Agents can optionally be authenticated against an external security provider, e.g. a Kerberos server (operator supplied), but typically they will be authenticated using a chosen PIN and an OTP.

A special Root Account is pre-configured in Crediverse when it is installed. All credit will initially be loaded into this account, before it is distributed or sold to other Agents or subscribers.

Agent accounts are stored separately from their personal information in a secured table within the database. Agent accounts have a secure signature which is used to detect any tampering by a third party.

=====  Agent Users

Agent Users are people employed by Agents to interact with Crediverse on their behalf.

A typical scenario is where a big Agent appoints administrative personnel in his office to assist him.

Agent Users will generally be granted a sub-set of the permissions held by the Agent, i.e. Agents Users will be restricted to perform only some of the actions his Agent is allowed to do.

It is also important to note that an Agent User doesn’t have his own account – if allowed to do so, he will trade with his Agent’s account.

Contact, demographic and Role membership information is amongst the information kept on record for each User Agent.

User Agents can optionally be authenticated against an external security provider, e.g. a Kerberos server (operator supplied), but typically they will be authenticated using a chosen PIN and an OTP.

=====  Tiers

Tiers serve to stratify the agent network into layers for the purpose of assigning common attributes and business rules to their member Agents.

[[figure-tier_types]]
.Tier Types
image::image005.png[align="center"]



Each Agent belongs to one and only one Tier.

The following Tier types are defined:

* Root – The top-most tier type from where all credit is distributed

* Store – A tier type designated to tiers of internal operator Agents or virtual agents.

* Wholesalers – A tier type designated to tiers of external Agents who don’t sell to the public directly.

* Resellers – A tier type designated to tiers of external Agents who do sell Airtime to the public directly.

Tiers can also be associated with Anti Money Laundering Limits.

=====  Groups

Agents may optionally be associated with a Group inside a Tier for the purpose of applying more granular business rules to Agents within a group.

Groups can also be associated with Anti Money Laundering Limits.

=====  Service Classes

Service Classes is yet another mechanism Crediverse provides to segment Agents across Tiers for the purpose of applying finer grain business rules to its members.

Service Class membership for Agents is optional.

Service Classes can also be associated with Anti Money Laundering Limits.

[[trading]]
==== Trading

=====  Location

In order to use Location Based Crediverse business rules, GSM Cells and Areas need to be defined.

Cells are defined in terms of their MCC, MNC, LAC and CellID and may also be associated with a geographical coordinate (Latitude and Longitude) for spatial analysis.

Areas define groupings of sub-Areas and Cells.

Business rules linked to a specific area will apply to all its contained Cells and Areas.

The location of an Agent is retrieved when:

* If he is ring-fenced to trade in a specific area

* If a Transfer Rule is area-specific

* If the operatorchooses to always retrieve the Agent’s location for a specific type of transaction

* If a transaction may qualify him for an Area-specific promotion

The location of an Agent is retrieved from the HLR with an MAP ATI request via the Signaling Gateway.

Agent locations are cached by Crediverse for a configurable period of time to reduce loading on HLRs.

=====  Bundles

In Crediverse, Agents have the option to sell Bundles of benefits, e.g. pre-defined combinations of Voice minutes, Data, SMS and MMS to subscribers instead of Airtime.

For this purpose, Bundles in Crediverse correspond to how they are defined by a Bundle Provider sub-system which provisions the Bundle on a Charging System.

=====  Transfer Rules

Transfer Rules govern under which circumstances transactions are allowed, and what Trade Bonus to award to the Agent as a result of the transaction.

Transfer Rules are defined in terms of source and target tiers, e.g. there will be one or more rules governing the sales of Airtime and Bundles from street vendors to the public.

Note: Crediverse does allow intra-tier transfers between Agents belonging to the same tier, which is not subject to Transfer Rules or any Trade Bonuses.

Transfer Rules can be predicated on any combination of the following parameters:

* Geographical Area

* Source and Target Group

* Source and Target Service Class

* Minimum or Maximum amounts

* Days of the Week

* Time of Day

In <<figure-example-tiers_and_transfer_rules>>, Transfer Rules are depicted as edges and Tiers as vertices:

[[figure-example-tiers_and_transfer_rules]]
.Example of Tiers and Transfer Rules
image::image006.png[align="center"]

=====  Promotions

Promotions allow the operatorto further incentivize Agents by rewarding them with additional Credit if they achieve a sales target for a specific set of circumstances and period of time.

Promotions can be defined in terms of

* Start and End Time

* Applicable Transfer Rule

* Geographical Area

* Agent Service Class

* Bundle Type

* Target Amount

* Target Period (e.g. per day, week or month)

All qualifying Agent transactions are evaluated periodically, and when an Agent qualifies for a particular promotion, his account will be credited with the defined reward amount or percentage.

[[business-intelligence]]
==== Business Intelligence

Suitably authorized Web Users have the ability to define reports and to schedule them to be automatically forwarded or mailed to the designated recipient(s).

Reports can be filtered, sorted and grouped as required by its recipients.

[[physical-deployment]]
== Physical Deployment

Crediverse is hosted on a scalable array of server computers, the size of which determined by the performance and reliability parameters required by an Operator.



The following servers are required to host Crediverse:

[[transaction-servers]]
=== Transaction Servers

Transaction Servers execute all business processes including transactions and Master Data amendments and update the state of its databases accordingly.

When more than one Transaction Server is deployed (recommended), the processing load will be shared dynamically between them.

The servers are co-located and dimensioned in such a way, that in case of a single machine failure, the remaining transaction servers will be able to handle the load comfortably.

Refer to the Concurrent Systems Hardware Specification Ref [1] for a definition and an example of a High Performance Server.

Concurrent Systems also strongly recommends the deployment of one or more offsite transaction servers for disaster recovery. These DR servers will be kept in sync with the state of the primary transaction servers and manually activated in the case of a multi-server failure in the primary cluster.

A suitable backup mechanism needs to be provided by the Operator, e.g. Tape Backup Devices (not recommended) or offsite/cloud mass storage (recommended).



[[figure-example-high_availability_transaction_server_configuration]]
.Example of a High Availability Transaction Server Configuration
image::image007.png[align="center"]



[[web-servers]]
=== Web Servers

The Crediverse Web Server is hosted on one or more separate general purpose medium performance servers, depending on the Operator’s performance and reliability requirements.

In the event of a single Web Server failure, the operatorwill be able to route all traffic to the remaining Web Servers.

Refer to the Concurrent Systems Hardware Specification Ref[1] for a definition and an example of a High Performance Server.

It is recommended to have two Load Balancer / Reverse Proxy Servers, which improve security. Refer to the Concurrent Systems Hardware Specification Ref [1] for a definition and an example of a Medium Performance Server.

It is also expected from the operatorto procure TLS certificates for end-to-end encryption of web traffic.

[[sgw-server]]
=== SGW Server

Signalling Gateway servers serve as a gateway between Crediverse Transaction Servers and the operator’s network for the purpose of implementing USSD, SMS and MAP Queries.

Concurrent Systems recommends the deployment SGW on two or more computers depending on the Operator’s performance and reliability requirements.

Refer to the Concurrent Systems Hardware Specification Ref [1] for a definition and an example of a Medium Performance Server.



[[integrations]]
=== Integrations

Crediverse integrates with the following intelligent network elements to realize its capabilities:



* Charging System for the provisioning of Airtime.

* A Bundle provider, e.g. PCC for provisioning of Bundles.

* An SMS-C to send notifications or initiate transactions.

* An SS7 gateway which facilitates USSD and MAP Queries.

* One or more MTAs for the purpose of sending eMail reports.

* An OSS for alarm monitoring.

* A data warehouse for analysis and business intelligence.

* A Domain Controller for the authentication of Web Users and optionally for Agents.

* Multi Mediation for dissemination of information generated by Crediverse.
